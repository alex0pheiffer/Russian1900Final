# Russian1900Final
Application for my Russian History Class.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate different views during different times of the Soviet Union (and, after 1991, Russia).
This was mostly written in second person to show a more personal connection with each path taken per scene.
I decided to do this for my final project because it is something I think the professor wanted the students to get out of the class, and I think it's interested to see how the events that occured affected everyone a bit differently.
A person's gender, race, geography, occupation, sexual orientation, and other factors all affect how they will interpret events and come to understand the world, which I think is important to analyze when discussing history.
